# Ensuring-Privacy-and-Transparency-inE-Voting-System-Using-Blockchain.
This project introduces a secure e-voting system built with blockchain technology to enhance privacy, transparency, and security in elections. By tackling challenges in traditional e-voting, the system ensures data immutability, reducing the risk of tampering.

Project Overview:
"Ensuring Privacy and Transparency in E-Voting System Using Blockchain" aims to create a secure, transparent, and user-friendly e-voting system. This blockchain-based solution addresses vulnerabilities in traditional electronic voting by establishing an immutable record of votes, enhancing both privacy and data integrity.
Using facial recognition and OTP verification, the system secures voter identities, preventing unauthorized access and reducing fraud. The combination of blockchainâ€™s immutable ledger and advanced security protocols builds a trustworthy platform, ultimately improving voter confidence and supporting fair elections.
